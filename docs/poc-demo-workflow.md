Hi David,

I wanted to share some exciting news about Sarah's progress. This week she had a real 
breakthrough with fraction multiplication. What impressed me most was how she persisted 
through the challenge and used multiple strategies to understand the concept.

The AI system captured her entire thinking process, and I can see she's developing 
strong mathematical reasoning skills. At home, you might try:
- Asking her to explain her math thinking to you
- Using real-world fraction examples (cooking, measuring)

She's building genuine confidence in mathematics. Great job supporting her learning at home!

Best,
Ms. Johnson
```

**Key Value**: *"Communication is proactive, specific, and focused on learning growth rather than just behavioral issues or grades."*
