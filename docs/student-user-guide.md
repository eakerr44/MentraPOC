## 🧮 Guided Problem Solving

### How Problem Solving Works

Mentra's AI helps you solve problems step-by-step without just giving you the answer. It's like having a patient tutor who asks the right questions to help you think through challenges.

#### Starting a Problem Session

1. **Choose a Problem Type:**
   - **Math Problems** - Equations, word problems, geometry
   - **Science Problems** - Experiments, analysis, concepts
   - **Writing Tasks** - Essays, creative writing, analysis

2. **Select Difficulty Level:**
   - **Beginner** - Building foundational skills
   - **Intermediate** - Applying what you know
   - **Advanced** - Challenging yourself with complex problems

3. **Begin Your Session** - The AI will guide you through step-by-step

#### How AI Scaffolding Works

Instead of giving you answers, Mentra helps you discover them:

**Step-by-Step Guidance:**
- AI breaks down complex problems into smaller steps
- Asks guiding questions to help you think
- Provides hints when you're stuck
- Celebrates your progress along the way

**Example Math Problem:**
```
Problem: "Sarah has 24 stickers. She wants to share them equally among 6 friends. How many stickers will each friend get?"

AI Guide:
🤖 "Let's break this down. What do we know?"
👤 "Sarah has 24 stickers and wants to share with 6 friends"
🤖 "Great! When we share things equally, what math operation do we use?"
👤 "Division?"
🤖 "Exactly! So what division problem do we need to solve?"
👤 "24 ÷ 6"
🤖 "Perfect! Can you solve that?"
```

#### Mistake Analysis and Learning

When you make mistakes, Mentra helps you learn from them:

**What Happens When You're Wrong:**
- AI asks questions to help you discover the error
- Guides you to understand why the mistake happened
- Shows you the correct approach step-by-step
- Helps you practice similar problems

**Example:**
```
Your Answer: 5 × 8 = 45
AI Response: "Let me help you check that. Can you count by 5s eight times? 5, 10, 15..."
You discover: "Oh! 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. It's 40, not 45!"
AI: "Excellent! What do you think caused the mix-up?"
```

#### Multiple Solution Paths

Many problems can be solved in different ways:

**Exploring Different Approaches:**
- AI might show you 2-3 different ways to solve the same problem
- You can choose the method that makes most sense to you
- Compare strategies to deepen your understanding

**Example - Solving 15 × 12:**
- **Method 1:** Traditional multiplication
- **Method 2:** Break it down (15 × 10) + (15 × 2)
- **Method 3:** Use the distributive property (10 × 12) + (5 × 12)

#### Problem Session Features

**Progress Tracking:**
- See how many problems you've completed
- Track improvement over time
- Celebrate milestones and achievements

**Session Analytics:**
- How much time you spent on each problem
