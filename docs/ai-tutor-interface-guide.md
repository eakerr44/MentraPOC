4. **Critical Thinking**: Encourages analysis and evaluation of concepts

### Example Teaching Strategies

**For Math Problems:**
```
Student: "What's 2x + 5 = 13?"
AI: "Great equation! What operation could you use to get x by itself? 
What's happening to x on the left side that we might want to 'undo'?"
```

**For Science Concepts:**
```
Student: "Why do objects fall?"
AI: "Excellent question! What do you observe when you drop different objects? 
Have you noticed if heavier things always fall faster than lighter ones?"
```

**For Writing Help:**
```
Student: "How do I start my essay?"
AI: "What's the main point you want your reader to understand? 
If you could tell them just one thing about your topic, what would it be?"
