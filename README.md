# Mentra - AI-Native Learning Platform

An AI-native learning platform that preserves the essence of education while evolving its function for the post-AI world.

## Overview

Mentra demonstrates intelligent scaffolding, personalized reflection, and multi-stakeholder engagement for students, teachers, and parents. Unlike traditional edtech tools that focus on task completion, Mentra emphasizes the learning journey through meaningful AI-powered interactions.

```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL (via Docker)

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
npm run install:all
```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env with your configuration
```

3. **Start development environment:**
```bash
# Start databases with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate

# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev
```

4. **Access the application:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001

## Development Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start both frontend and backend in development mode
- `npm run build` - Build both applications for production
- `npm run test` - Run all tests
- `npm run migrate` - Run database migrations
- `npm run clean` - Clean all node_modules

## Testing the System

### Database Testing
```bash
# Test PostgreSQL connection
cd backend && node src/scripts/migrate.js

# Test vector database (ChromaDB)
cd backend && node src/scripts/test-vector-db.js
```

### API Testing
```bash
# Test all services health
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Test database status
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/database/status

# Test vector database status  
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/vector-db/status

# Test context manager
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/context/status
```
